We were not able to add a slider to the old project, so instead we created a new calcinda, but this time with a sliding drawer.
The slider contains the buttons on the landscape mode.
The functionality of this slider is currently not implemented correctly, and thus the buttons don't work.
Evertyhing else is working correctly though, as in calcinda.
