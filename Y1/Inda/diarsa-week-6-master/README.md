### Auction Project

#### Exercise 4.48
Add a `close` method to the Auction class. This should iterate over the collection of lots and print out details of all the lots. Use a for-each loop. Any lot that has had at least one bid for it is considered to be sold, so what you are looking for is Lot objects whose `highestBid` field is not null. Use a local variable inside the loop to store the value returned from calls to the `getHighestBid` method, and then test that variable for the null value.

For lots with a bidder, the details should include the name of the successful bidder and the value of the winning bid. For lots with no bidder, print a message that indicates this.

#### Exercise 4.49
Add a `getUnsold` method to the Auction class with the following header:

```java
public ArrayList<Lot> getUnsold()
```

This method should iterate over the `lots` field, storing unsold lots in a new ArrayList local variable. What you are looking for is Lot objects whose `highestBid` field is null. At the end of the method, return the list of unsold lots.

#### Exercise 4.50
Suppose that the Auction class includes a method that makes it possible to remove a lot from the auction. Assuming that the remaining lots do not have their `lotNumber` fields changed when a lot is removed, write down what you think the impact would be on the getLot method.

#### Exercise 4.51
Rewrite `getLot` so that it does not rely on a lot with a particular number being stored at index (number–1) in the collection. For instance, if lot number 2 has been removed, then lot number 3 will have been moved from index 2 to index 1, and all higher lot numbers will also have been moved by one index position. You may assume that lots are always stored in increasing order according to their lot numbers.

#### Exercise 4.52
Add a removeLot method to the Auction class, having the following header:

```java
/**
 * Remove the lot with the given lot number.
 * @param number The number of the lot to be removed.
 * @return The Lot with the given number, or null if
 * there is no such lot.
 */
public Lot removeLot(int number)
```

This method should not assume that a lot with a given number is stored at any particular location within the collection.

### Stock Manager Project

#### Exercise 4.56
Open the product project and complete the StockManager class through this and the next few exercises. StockManager uses an ArrayList to store Product items. Its `addProduct` method already adds a product to the collection, but the following methods need completing: `delivery`, `findProduct`, `printProductDetails`, and `numberInStock`.

Each product sold by the company is represented by an instance of the Product class, which records a product’s ID, name, and how many of that product are currently in stock. The Product class defines the `increaseQuantity` method to record increases in the stock level of that product. The `sellOne` method records that one item of that product has been sold, by reducing the `quantity` field level by 1. Product has been provided for you, and you should not need to make any alterations to it.

Start by implementing the `printProductDetails` method to ensure that you are able to iterate over the collection of products. Just print out the details of each Product returned, by calling its `toString` method.

#### Exercise 4.57
Implement the `findProduct` method. This should look through the collection for a product whose `id` field matches the ID argument of this method. If a matching product is found, it should be returned as the method’s result. If no matching product is found, return null.

This differs from the `printProductDetails` method in that it will not necessarily have to examine every product in the collection before a match is found. For instance, if the first product in the collection matches the product ID, iteration can finish and that first Product object can be returned. On the other hand, it is possible that there might be no match in the collection. In that case, the whole collection will be examined without finding a product to return. In this case, the null value should be returned.

When looking for a match, you will need to call the `getID` method on a Product.

#### Exercise 4.58
Implement the `numberInStock` method. This should locate a product in the collection with a matching ID and return the current quantity of that product as a method result. If no product with a matching ID is found, return zero. This is relatively simple to implement once the `findProduct` method has been completed. For instance, `numberInStock` can call the `findProduct` method to do the searching and then call the `getQuantity` method on the result. Take care over products that cannot be found, though.

#### Exercise 4.59
Implement the `delivery` method using a similar approach to that used in `numberInStock`. It should find the product with the given ID in the list of products and then call its `increaseQuantity` method.

### Log Analyzer Project

#### Exercise 4.73
Complete the `numberOfAccesses` method, below, to count the total number of accesses recorded in the log file. Complete it by using a for loop to iterate over `hourCounts`:

```java
/**
 * Return the number of accesses recorded in the log
 * file.
 */
public int numberOfAccesses() {
	int total = 0;
	// Add the value in each element of hourCounts // to total.
	...
	return total;
}
```

#### Exercise 4.74
Add your `numberOfAccesses` method to the LogAnalyzer class and check that it gives the correct result.

Hint: You can simplify your checking by having the analyzer read log files containing just a few lines of data. That way you will find it easier to determine whether or not your method gives the correct answer. The LogfileReader class has a constructor with the following header, to read from a particular file:

```java
/**
 * Create a LogfileReader that will supply data
 * from a particular log file.
 * @param filename The file of log data.
 */
public LogfileReader(String filename)
```

#### Exercise 4.75
Add a method `busiestHour` to LogAnalyzer that returns the busiest hour. You can do this by looking through the `hourCounts` array to find the element with the biggest count.

Hint: Do you need to check every element to see if you have found the busiest hour? If so, use a for loop or a for-each loop. Which one is better in this case?

#### Exercise 4.76
Add a method `quietestHour` to LogAnalyzer that returns the number of the least busy hour. Note: This sounds almost identical to the previous exercise, but there is a small trap for the unwary here. Be sure to check your method with some data in which every hour has a non-zero count.

#### Exercise 4.77
Which hour is returned by your `busiestHour` method if more than one hour has the biggest count?

#### Exercise 4.78
Add a method to LogAnalyzer that finds which two-hour period is the busiest. Return the value of the first hour of this period.
